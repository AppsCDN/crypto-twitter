# crypto-twitter

This is a bot that Tweets out new coins that have been added to CoinGecko's recently added page. This is to help people find low-market-cap gems before they blast off 100% - 500%.

It currently only scrapes Coingecko, but more functionality is coming soon: Uniswap scraping, updates on coin growth, etc. Feel free to make a pull request if you want to implement a useful feature. You'll have to hook it up to your API keys first though.

You can follow it here:

This is a bot that scrapes CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap and makes a tweet whenever there is a new coin added. This is to help people find low-market-cap gems before they blast off 100% - 500%.


Feel free to make a pull request if you want to implement a useful feature. You'll have to hook it up to your API keys first though.

> 9/21/20:
 - Added CoinMarketCap scraping! Now the bot will tweet out new coins from both CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap
 - Removed price % change. Most of the new coins that are added have no data on them when the bot finds them, so having data on how much the price has changed in the last hour/day was worthless.
 - New name / icon for the bot. Now that it scrapes more than just CoinGecko, a new name was needed


TODO:
 - Uniswap scraping
 - Updates on coin growth
